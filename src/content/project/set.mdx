## About

A fully functional game of 1-player [Set](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)>) built entirely from scratch as part of
Stanford's CS193p [mid-term assisgment](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj16636/files/media/file/assignment_3_0.pdf).

## Stack

- Functional UI programming using SwiftUI 2.0 and Swift 5.5
- Data architecture using MVC
- Motion using SwiftUI animation library

## Features

### Deck and Discard Pile

Keep track of discraded cards from the game and deal new cards from the undealt pile.

## Thoughts

Architecting the app from scratch was particularly challening as there was no real road-map or implementation guidelines. The hints, however, did guide me through what I needed a head of implementing a particulary feature which helped me create a mental model of the implementation priority list. Animation took the longest to implement as I wasn't
well-wersed with the unique animation system of SwiftUI. The set matching alogrithm took many iterations to reach a fast, perfomant and functional state, but in the end I am extremely proud of the outcome I was able to achieve in 2 weeks after only having used Swift and SwiftUI for 2 weeks.
