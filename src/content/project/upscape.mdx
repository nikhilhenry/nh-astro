## Challenges

This was my hands-on project with golang apart from tutorials. The most complicated aspect of building the back-end was the intergation with MongoDB. Unfortunately, Go does not have a convienient ORM for MongoDB like [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) for javascript. Instead, I ended up writing all the queries myself using the [official database drive](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/). Apart from the minor greviance, building the API using Gin was actually pretty simple and its framework structure was pretty intutive although albiet not as simple as [express](https://expressjs.com/).
